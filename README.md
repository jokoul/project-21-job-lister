# project-22-job-lister

## Description

I achieve this dynamical job search and posting website using PHP OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and MySQL databse which is a database management system (DBMS). I use MVC design pattern to structure my project's architecture. I did advanced SQL query with inner join to perform CRUD operation. I create Class like Job, Template, Database and instantiate them to use their properties and methods at different places through my code.
